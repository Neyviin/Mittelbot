# Mittelbot Privacy Policy
Last updated 01.06.2023

At Mittelbot, accessible from mittelbot.blackdayz.de, one of our main priorities is the privacy of our visitors. This Privacy Policy describes the types of information Mittelbot collects and tracks, and how we use that information.

If you have any questions or need more information about our privacy policy, please do not hesitate to contact us.

This Privacy Policy applies only to our online activities and is valid for visitors to our website with regard to the information they share and/or collect in Mittelbot. This policy does not apply to information collected offline or through channels other than this website.

## Consent
By using our website and discord bot, you agree to our privacy policy and agree to be bound by its terms.

## Information we collect
The following information is collected from users:

Server Ids
Text channel ids
User ids

## Why we need your information
We need the information described above to provide you with the basic services we offer.

## How we use your information
We use the information we collect in the following ways:

Provide, operate and maintain our website and Discord Bot
Provide all the functionality that the bot has to offer

WE DO NOT SHARE ANY OF THE INFORMATION WE COLLECT WITH THIRD PARTIES.

## Logs
Mittelbot follows a standard practice of using log files. These files log visitors when they visit websites. All hosting companies do this and it is part of the analysis of hosting services. The information collected by log files includes Internet Protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, Internet Service Provider (ISP), date and time stamp, referring/exit pages, and possibly the number of clicks. This information is not linked to any personally identifiable information. This information is used to analyse trends, administer the site, track user's movement around the site and gather demographic information for aggregate use.
We also use Sentry software to log errors or debug messages on our self-hosted system.

## Data removal
The data removal process works in one way.

Discord server data (such as custom server settings, infractions, ticket data etc.)

To have server data removed, please contact us on discord. Note that we don't support data removal while the bot is still on your server, due to the risk of fatal problems caused by missing data.
And note that if you invite the bot back to your server, it will automatically create new default data associated with your server.

If you would like to have your user data removed, please contact us on discord.


## Third party privacy policies
Mittelbot's privacy policy does not apply to other advertisers or websites. We encourage you to review the privacy policies of these third-party ad servers for more detailed information. This may include their practices and instructions on how to opt-out of certain options.

## Information about children
Another of our priorities is to help protect children when they use the Internet. We encourage parents and guardians to observe, participate in and/or monitor and guide their online activities.

Mittelbot does not knowingly collect any personally identifiable information from children under the age of 13. If you believe that your child has provided such information on our website, we strongly encourage you to contact us immediately and we will use our best efforts to promptly remove such information from our records and report it to the Discord Trust and Safety Team due to TOS violating activity on Discord.
